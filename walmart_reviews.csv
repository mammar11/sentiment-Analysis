9,"4 out of 5 stars review8/7/2023It's okay![This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It's a television and was priced okay. Just so many televisions out there that you can buy 2 instead of having 1 for the same price. I do like the smart things feature but recently other brands have also adapted to remote use with your phone.  The speakers are also okay, like all televisions nowadays required a separate sound system.Morenoj198100Written by aSamsung UScustomer"

12,"5 out of 5 stars review8/9/2023cTV REVIEW[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use my HDMI connection to the cable box. I watch my basic cable on there with the massive screen. I love it. Such a relief from what I had prior. 

I'm pretty well known on Youtube so when there's nothing going on I'll check my youtube comments or watch some of my favorite subscriptions. I like how I'm automatically signed in. 

I'm single as of right now, but I can see all the internet movies the tv automatically offers being the perfect opportunity to relax and unwind with a date.Mrforte24700Written by aSamsung UScustomer"

43,"4 out of 5 stars review7/6/2023Great TV, but the remote is awful[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I just got the TV mounted above my mantel with a pull down mount.
It great, the picture quality is amazing.  It connected seemlessly with my soundbar.
The problem is the remote.  It looks nice and simple. The big problem is that the levers to control the sound and channel have very sharp edges that dig into my fingers.  It seems to be a extremely poor choice in the design of the remote.  I see myself buying some generic remote to replace it.HomeMovieBuf00Written by aSamsung UScustomer"

61,"4 out of 5 stars review6/1/2023Love Samsung t.v.[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been a loyal Samsung user since 2008, only recently have been blessed enough to be able to experience their t.v.s, this particular model has a great picture quality and average playable aspects, i juts wish the sound was more adaptive. It's the only complaint i have, although we don't currently have it mounted, so that could be. Contributiing factor. As is, on the stand though, that attempt for a more full sound tends to overwhelmingly focus on background, music, FX, etc and leaves a lot to be desired as far as voice and spatial are concerned.

65,5 out of 5 stars review5/15/2023Bedroom Beauty[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Samsung is known for making great products and this tv does not disappoint.  The tv is extremely light and thin was very simple to put on the wall.  The setup was quick and easy.  The remote is simple to navigate and has a solar panel on the back. The highlight of this television set is the picture.  The picture is literally crystal clear.  Whatever the crystal processor thing is that this tv has is most definitely working.adele14300Written by aThe Insiderscustomer

88,4 out of 5 stars reviewVerified PurchaserHappy customer.I ordered online and had shipped to my home. Box arrived intact with no sign of damaged. Tv was packaged perfectly for a fragile item. Color is great I have no complaints. The sound increases to 100. I do feel the speakers are on the low side. Playing music and certain shows you would think that on 100 it would be blaring. I’m thinking of buying a sound bar to achieve a better sound system. I love the Samsung brand. This is my second tv by the supplier both bought at Walmart. My curved Samsung I had for 3  years broke due to human damage but worked excellent before it was broken. This 65” was its replacement and I’m happy yet again.Brittany

92,"3 out of 5 stars reviewVerified Purchaser8/14/2023Samsung 65in TVThe Tv is a great upgrade, but there are few downsides about it. 

(1)- Tv lags regularly when trying to open different streaming apps and loads slow 

(2)- Connecting to the internet. 
It says it's not connected but my internet shows everything is working. 

(3)- you can not share screen from phone to tv in case you wanted to watch a game from your phone and want to put it on the tv , well it's not compatible for iPhone and surprisingly Samsung too. 

Overall if you don't mind the trouble we'll then the tv just works fine.Edward00"

The picture quality is great and screen size is decent to watch any show. I am actually very happy watching 4k movies on this TV. You just need to add another good sound bar system. Samsung's smart system is easy to use and works great too (I prefer it compared to LG's one). There are free shows and movies you can watch there too.kualafication00Written by aSamsung UScustomer"
127,"5 out of 5 stars review7/5/2023Spectacular Picture!!![This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I watched “TV” on my iPhone for three-plus years. My TV had stopped working and I was determined to have it repaired.   The pandemic made me care less.  My 88 year old Mother could not understand why I did not just buy another TV.  She finally gave me a check for $500 and told me to buy a TV, NOW! LOL I had enough money left over to also buy a TV wall mount. I had plenty of money to buy my own TV, but she wanted the credit and her insistence made me feel guilty.  I often thank her for her insistence and the extravagant gift.  

Before purchasing, I spent a great deal of time checking reviews. I decided the CU7000B was the TV for me. I love the crisp picture, excellent speaker quality and t...See moreTrumpetaddict00Written by aSamsung UScustomer"
128,"5 out of 5 stars review7/22/2023Awesome tv[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Crystal UHD TVs are known for their crisp and vibrant picture quality, offering enhanced color reproduction and sharpness. They often support high dynamic range (HDR) technologies, such as HDR10 or Dolby Vision, which provide a wider range of colors and improved contrast. This can result in more realistic, lifelike images that offer a more immersive viewing experience.

In terms of smart features, Crystal UHD TVs usually come equipped with smart platforms like Tizen or webOS, depending on the manufacturer. These platforms offer access to a variety of streaming apps, allowing you to enjoy popular content from services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu.

It has all the capabilities I could ask for and has settings in the remote so I can easily find my streaming apps. I also love the color definition and different options to change display settings for when I'm watching a movie or a colorful show. I love everything about it and it's cool to have a few built in live channels to browse. The Crystal UHD 65 inch was the best purchase I could have made for a new TV. I have another smaller 35 in Samsung and it compliments the other so well. Samsung has the best resolution and the best color for a TV.Samsunglove00Written by aSamsung UScustomer

Every time I turn it on well, it's never off really. I can see the blemishes and wrinkles on people's faces. It's almost, all most too good. The sound is pretty good also and reverberates off the wall and makes it surround sound. You have to put it on the wall. If I outlive this TV (I hope) I will buy a 4th. There wasn't anything wrong with the 40 inch but I moved it to the bedroom. Anyway I have Samsung phones, tvs and refrigerator. Great products!Nikki5196400Written by aSamsung UScustomer"

I am very active with home/family/friends graphics-based projects on my Apple devices, and this set's 55"" screen is --for me-- perfection for color matching and minute color/shape/shadow shade and tone  nitpicking --like when designing my fauxe stained glass panels.

201,"1 out of 5 stars reviewVerified Purchaser8/27/2023BewareI ordered this online and it was delivered to my home. When I open the TV box? I'm saying that this was actually a return. Nothing was in the box except for the TV.  No remote, no power cord. No owner's manual and the base legs were missing. I had a man come to my house this morning to install the TV this morning.  And when we discovered what was in the box? I had to go and return the product. It cost me $200 for the man who was going to help me. And I never got his help. Beware when you order a TV through Walmart they might Send you a returned product that someone else kept all of the accessories .
I'm very disappointed with this order.

When I checked my front door, I did not find the package. A neighbor came over to me and told me there was a package left in my driveway and when I go check, this is what I find.

Also bought a Samsung sound bar at the same time and am impressed with that as well. Only annoying thing on that is I wish they had a way to mount them together without needing aftermarket mounts. It should come with something for the same brand TV.

Not because it didn't work but because I wanted a new modern smart TV Samsung builds TV's to last,  16 years is a long time for a TV hold up and keep working         
    Anyway A few weeks ago I purchased  a 43 inch Tu7000 for the bedroom.    I was seeking a thin modern affordable TV with a great picture    This was the ultimate choice!   I also find this model has decent internal sound,  without a soundbar   but of course you can always add one which I'll do soon to watch my music videos.

227,"5 out of 5 stars review10/5/2022Happy with the clear display[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased my 43"" TV for many reasons. It is the only TV in our home. I was seriously disappointed with the remote that was included with my purchase. I wanted a sleek style samsung remote that I am familiar with but instead my 43"" came with a basic remote with rubber buttons. Which remote I have is not of great importance because I use a roku remote/streaming stick as my primary remote anyway. It was easy to set up and I installed a TV stand immediately after my purchase to make my device sit stable on my entertainment center for peace of mind around my small child.

229,"5 out of 5 stars review9/28/2022Great, but blurry at night.[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Like I said, it is great!  The TV is huge, but only took this handicap old man and his youngest son to lift this TV 6' off the ground to mount it.  It is balanced and weighted well, as stated.  Moreover, I primarily watch TV at night, so I tend to see blurry like shadow images as figures move somewhat faster on the TV than normal.  I was raised to not complain, and this is HUGE.

272,"5 out of 5 stars review10/25/2022Great TV for Football[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great TV. Great picture. I mostly watch sports…perfect for watching football. The only complaint I have is that it does not fully integrate with my sound bar. I may be upgrading to a Samsung sound bar so it fully integrates.,Ajcam4500Written by aSamsung UScustomer"
273,"5 out of 5 stars review10/13/2022Ease of use[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For an economical TV or lower priced TV it is a steal,  alot if TV for a very resonable price. The features are easy to navigate the pre installed apps are great and finding new apps is a breeze. If one is looking for a good TV on a budget then this would be just what your looking for.Harris00Written by aSamsung UScustomer"

It was easy to program and use. The remote is a bit different but very handy with a Netflix,  prime video, and Samsung TV plus buttons.

275,"5 out of 5 stars review10/26/2022Amazing picture, sound, and features[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Hands down an awesome tv for gaming, streaming, and watching sports. The colors are crisp and vivid, while the contrast is is nice and smooth. I was impressed with the rich sound from the tv speakers and found no need to connect a sound bar or other audio device. The smart features are numerous, with an intuitive interface that is easy to navigate and simple to understand, and truly making connecting a breeze. An absolute steal for the price.Dataface00Written by aSamsung UScustomer"

277,"5 out of 5 stars review10/26/2022Best purchase this year![This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My new Samsung tv has exceeded expectations so far. I now prefer watching football games at home, as my tv delivers the best picture and sound I have seen so far - it almost feels like I’m at the stadium! The 4k aspect makes the color stand out from anything I have owned before, from the uniforms to blades of grass. Thank you Samsung for improving my viewing experience, as this tv is EASILY my favorite purchase this year!SportsLover00Written by aSamsung UScustomer"
278,"4 out of 5 stars review10/25/2022Great TV For The Money[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had this TV just over a year now. I upgraded from another Samsung that was several years older. The picture is significantly better than what I had (I know this is still lower quality than what is out there currently) and for the price I am not sure you can get a 65"" TV at this quality for cheaper. 

Also bought a Samsung sound bar at the same time and am impressed with that as well. Only annoying thing on that is I wish they had a way to mount them together without needing aftermarket mounts. It should come with something for the same brand TV.

Only problem I have been having with the TV is after about a year I have had wifi connection issues. It is very intermittent and all I nee...See moreDonnie00Written by aSamsung UScustomer"

We use it to stream all of our streaming apps. It will conect to our phones easly, and love the picture when playing on my PS4.

282,"5 out of 5 stars review10/26/2022great quality at a great price[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have an older 36"" Samsung  (2006 Touch Of Red model)  I wanted to replace.    Not because it didn't work but because I wanted a new modern smart TV Samsung builds TV's to last,  16 years is a long time for a TV hold up and keep working         
    Anyway A few weeks ago I purchased  a 43 inch Tu7000 for the bedroom.    I was seeking a thin modern affordable TV with a great picture    This was the ultimate choice!   I also find this model has decent internal sound,  without a soundbar   but of course you can always add one which I'll do soon to watch my music videos.

283,"5 out of 5 stars review10/5/2022Happy with the clear display[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased my 43"" TV for many reasons. It is the only TV in our home. I was seriously disappointed with the remote that was included with my purchase. I wanted a sleek style samsung remote that I am familiar with but instead my 43"" came with a basic remote with rubber buttons. Which remote I have is not of great importance because I use a roku remote/streaming stick as my primary remote anyway. It was easy to set up and I installed a TV stand immediately after my purchase to make my device sit stable on my entertainment center for peace of mind around my small child. I also own a samsung galaxy zflip 4 and plan on purchasing more Samsung products in the future.RainRain00Written by aSamsung UScustomer"
284,4 out of 5 stars review9/30/2022Solid tv for avg person[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So I have the 7000 series wall mounted in my living room. After years of being my parents living room TV and anniversary present from me they bought a new qled Samsung and gave this one back to me. It has screen burn in from when they left a DVD menu up on the screen one night. Then I have a TU8300 curved 55 inch that I just bought and never watch that sits under my wall mounted one on a TV stand. It would look dumb being wall mounted since it's curved.Uknowwhatitis00Written by aSamsung UScustomer
285,"5 out of 5 stars review9/28/2022Great, but blurry at night.[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Like I said, it is great!  The TV is huge, but only took this handicap old man and his youngest son to lift this TV 6' off the ground to mount it.  It is balanced and weighted well, as stated.  Moreover, I primarily watch TV at night, so I tend to see blurry like shadow images as figures move somewhat faster on the TV than normal.  I was raised to not complain, and this is HUGE.
Much appreciated as a consumer.FmcGhee100Written by aSamsung UScustomer"
