I would like to rate 4/5 . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantage I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.My requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2) Rear Camera is More than enough (50 Mp No shake (OIS) Camera  ll give the performance as Sony camera mobile. (Good for both day night photography)(Front camera is not upto the mark)3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.Cons :-1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic  . AverageOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile camera4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .No more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Suggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display , camera and battery you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates.Thank you...‚ù§Ô∏è

üëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëáüëá*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average üòÜ but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use  smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,

I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get  the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !

I will keep it really brief because there a lot of reviews explaining everything and a ton of youtube videos. In short words, the product is amazing. The things which are really good are Camera, mainly 50MP and the front cam; Display, battery backup and Samsung UI.The major disappointment is the unavailability of charger in the box, which is actually a deal breaker for many because there are a lot of phones in this price providing the same. Another thing is the absence of even basic screen guard and back cover. Now all the rival brands are providing and this being a new launch, its impossible to find the right tempered glass and back cover for atleast 3 months. The gorilla glass is not much to rely on as I had a scratch just by putting in pocket. Inspite of all this I still went for this because of a really good exchange deal from Amazon.

Got the phone at 15k with charger, why you should buy it ???1/camera - best camera under this price range with ois support, no brand is offering this at this price range. Also what sets apart samsung from other chinese brands is that it does not whiten you face üòÇüòÇ.....speaking from a persceptive of real me 8 user.2/ ui - best ui with unique features like knox security,  samsung pay , object eraser, nfc which no brand offers. It got the best in class customization & ui experience. It will get 4 major android update too which is also the best.3/ performance - in this case the processor is not that good there are some lags in the ui maybe it will solve after updates. As of 1st Aug it did not get any updates. 120hz feels very smooth too.4/ battery - with 25 w charger it can be charged upto 85 to 90 % under 50 min from 30% which is decent.  85% with basic usage will last a day easily.5/ speakers - they are not stereo speakers but it has very good bass and treble. Also the output of eraphones is very good.So if you are looking for a phone which has a very powerful processor with losts of bloatware which can charge within 10 min then this is not the one for you. If you want a best camera phone with great ui experience, good battery life, decent performance, moderately fast charging phone then this is the perfect phone for you.Previously I have used lumia , Micromax, zenphone,  real me8 . I can definitely say this ia the best phone that I have used so far. I will not be able to switch to any other chinese brands after the experience of one ui.

This phone is not a:* Gaming phone* High performance phonePerforms day to day tasks with ease and may be basic gaming.Call quality is decent.What is Good:* Amoled display* Dolby Atmos* HIGHLY OPTIMISED phone - so battery lasts longer not just because of bigger battery.* 6000 Mah battery - Depending upon usage, it can easily last 1.5 day and upto 2 days* Decent camera* Few bloatware* 4yrs OS update and 5 yrs security update (but not sure if the phone can handle 3rd or the 4th OS update)* Screen brightess is Good and viewable under direct sunlight.* No in screen finger print scanner - Meaning if for some reason you have to replace the screen, it will be slightly less expensive. Amoled screens with fingerprint scanner will cost you half your phones priceWhat to expect:* From time to time you may notice slowness/lag - If you have too many apps installed* Not intended for high memory utilizing apps* Slight Heating issues from time to time* Slow charging if you don't use Samsung fast charger. Tried 33W fast charger - charging is still slow.* May not be able to handle Android OS 15 or later updates* Videos can be viewed at maximum resolution of 1080P. Does not support 1220p or 1440P.* Has only single stereo speaker* It's better not to charge the phone when it's hot, charging will be slow even with Samsung charger.Note: It's an old chipset known for heating issues. The same chipset was used in Samsung M33. The only reason it works well, is because the OS is highly optimised.The phone is for those users:a) Who performs basic to medium tasks/activities.b) Stable phone with regular OS updates and security patchesc) Intends to use the phone for 3+yrsIf you do decide to buy this phone, I would recommend you to go with 8GB ram else go for something else.Alternate phones - Infinix GT 10

I have some mixed reviews about this phone.1. I love the camera. It's quite amazing. You can see some snapshots.2. Battery is awesome.3. Display is quite good. But here I have something to tell you guys. After purchasing, 8days later somehow my phone dropped from my bed. With back cover and tempered glass.. But the fluid comes out and you can see what happens with my display in the last uploaded pic. Samsung says it won't comes under any warranty. So, I have to spend 6k for display change.I've got this phone 15k arround.So, apart from what happened to me, I am quite happy with this phone. If u r buying this, please order cover and screen protector first.Review after 20days-My phone dropped from my bed with back cover and tempered glass. Display damaged. Samsung service center says they won't cover warrenty of this display. So I ordered the display paying 6k rs on 27th July. Today is 6 August, they said to me that in whole India they don't have a single unit display of this phone, so probably they arranged it from UK. Amazon says, ""please get a service denial letter from Samsung so they can do something"". Moral of the story, I'm stuck between Samsung and Amazon, using my mom's phone. Not a good service experience from Samsung and Amazon.

Reviewing after 20 days.This phone is really very nice from all aspects. 1. The best camara in this  budget2. The best UI experience the Samsung One UI3. The knox security4. The best Super Amoled display.5. Good for moderate gaming.6. 6000mAh batteryI've been using this phone from last 20-25 days. I am a guy who uses phone the whole day. And trust me, I've not experienced any lag or any problem till now. And the camara üòçmind blowing... You can easily play heavy game for 1 hour. But for extreme level gaming go for IQOO7.

Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory  use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile

This one might be one of the best budget products from the house of samsung. I was looking for a budget smartphone for my mom as her old phone was seemingly bent for some reason.I use a Samsung s22+ which I had bought from a local store in Kolkata last year around July. Since then it has been a good experience with samsung. They have a proper customer service base which is really reliable, thus I chose M34 for my mom.This M34 runs at 120hz always where as my s22+ runs on adaptive mode, so the M34 feels smoother on hand than s22+.It looks stunning, UI is fluid, sound is loud, network reception okay, haptic feedback is nice, battery life is more than 2 days while it latches on a Wi-Fi network.Got it for around 8k. (Exchanged with a mi phone)
"
23,"
I bought this mobile for my mom and the main reason i chose M34 is for its Display(AMOLED screen) and 4 years of OS update. After using couple of weeks i can say that it meet my expectation and battery comes around 1.5 days with moderate usage. The only issue i noticed is 5G speed is slowcompared to my mobile(M53). I have used the same sim to calculate the speed and allother settings are same. Overall its a good buy.
"
24,"
Display is really great. Samsung could have provide punch hole instead of u-notch.Battery is really monstor‚Ä¶. For regular use it is lasting for 2 days.Performance is decent as compared with my One plus nord CE 2 lite.Fast charging can be improved. It took more than 1:30hr for full charging.
"
25,"
For this prize range it's kind of a good phone.Does basic things without issues but recently started to see wifi signal isn't that consistent on this device. Batter is magnificent display is good but camera is oversaturrraed but looking at prize it's kinda k.So in all m not blown away by this phone neither very upset about it. And I don't want to spend 1lkh + each two years on flagship so if ur also of same view go for it
"
26,"
It seems I have downgraded my mobile by buying M34 and exchanging it with my old A71. The only positive sides are - (1) 8 GB memory (earlier I had 6 GB memory), (2) 5G instead of 4G, and (3) 6000 MaH battery (earlier I had 5000 MaH).The phone has serious design flaw.(1)The fingerprint scanner is at the side of the phone instead of on-screen. I bought a back-cover for the phone and now the fingerprint scanner is totally covered by the back cover. I am facing extreme difficulty in logging in to my secure apps and office apps.(2) The sim tray can accommodate either 2 sim cards, or 1 sim card and 1 memory card. In my earlier phone - Galaxy A71, I could insert 2 sims and 1 memory card in one tray. That is gone now.(3) The phone does not even support e-sim feature. This is now very common in every phone in this price segment.(4) Overheating. It heats up even when I put it on charging.Overall, I feel my money is not well utilized.

Nice battery back up nice camera and display is the best in class and it should be an punch hole camera but it come with dew drop camera that is the only bummer but they make it up in software support

I am only talk about the cons because u already know the pros1.

Presumably, the Samsung Galaxy M34 would be a mid-range smartphone, likely featuring improvements over its predecessor, the Galaxy M33. Samsung's M-series typically offers decent performance, a large display, and a good camera setup at an affordable price point. You can expect a powerful processor, ample RAM, and a decent battery capacity, making it suitable for everyday tasks and light gaming.I like color of my mobile and only thing is that I am disappointed mobile charge time its take 1hour 25 minute to full charge
"

Phone is definitely worth it. Colour is definitely eye-catching. At this price range it's a great option.This time Amazon disappoint me by the package condition. The seal of the main box is already broken.

The greatest disadvantage is that it does not have dedicated MSD slot, but a SIM/SD hybrid slot. Most people use dual SIM for which separate MSD Card can't be used. Moreover, this hybrid slot does not seem to be compatible with all MSD cards.I tried several ones, the set suffered hang.Ultimately, I went in for Samsung MSD Card & only then it worked. This is a great disadvantage & negative point for an otherwise good handset.Battery, display, pro cession seems good. Camera seems OK, but not very good. Overall it is a good mid-range set, if one is ready to compromise certain issues/facilities.

Well i will elaborate this, the wifi signal goes down while putting hand on the top edge of the phone. So while gaming the connectivity fluctuates a lot, along with this, it takes a while in scanning other wifi connections r switching between other connection.Else the product is awsm and powerfull at this price rangeWorth buying...Happy shopping üõç

Reviewing After 10 days of usage:Video stabilization of rear camera is not upto the expectation. Front camera video stabilization is better than the rear camera.Battery backup is quite average for me, expected a lot from 6000mah battery..It takes 1 hour and 10 mins to reach 85% from 35% ... even though i use mostly social medias without gaming, it doesn't give much backup as I've expected (using internet with wifi connection, reduced to 60hz refresh rate)..(attached screenshot of battery usage)

This is very average phone for this price point, amoled was very average. Lot of bloatwares.. poor RAM management, wifi reception is very poor. Battery is average if you charger 85% it will last one day if you're not gamer. If you play any games this phone is not suitable for you, wifi calling very frustrated frequently switching to volte and wifi, samsungs OS upgrade is a gimik, this phone won't last for 4 years, based on my last 2 weeks usage. Samsung please try to avoid these type of toys, we are buying phones from Samsung for your credibility, these kind of phones will lose your credibility.

On July 16, 2023, a Samsung Galaxy M34 was given to me. Phone was excellent, but when I attached the power bank to the phone, if the power bank became empty and you removed it, the phone will continue to alert you that the USB port was disconnected or connected.There is no way to remove this bag; it is what it is. To delete the notification in this situation, you must restart your mobile device.

After using over month. I found touch and feel is good.Camera is just ok not as good as i used in 7T. It literally hangs most times when you multi task.

Hope it gives some idea whether to choose this or not.

For daily use it's ok, if 120hz refresh rate screen turned on then the battery will drain in a day. And main camera is not supported OIS, no shake camera only works to take video but the quality of video will get decrease. Big bulky mobile, sometime lag issues can be seen. Jio 4g won't work properly as it automatically takes 5G. If 5G option turned on battery will drain Faster.

Every review that you have seen about this phone is true to quite an extent.Great camera, good features, and premium quality and is the perfect size for me. I would prefer a 6"" phone but that's the best you can get. It's a little on the heavier side but it doesn't really matter if you are using headphones.The cons:1 - Battery drains really fast. The reviews I saw did not warn about it. This is my biggest grudge, having gone a bit over budget.2 - Samsung's boring UI. BTW I never imagined I would buy a Samsung product. But seeing the comparos with iPhone 14, I felt I should give it a go. One Plus, for instance, gives a swipe option to go back to the previous page. Samsung still depends on the back button at the bottom of the phone. After using One Plus, this seems prehistoric and inconvenient. It would request Samsung if they make this small change.3 - For some weird reason, it takes very long to start. It's a costly phone. I do not expect it to be so slow4 - Again, the reviews I watched said it only warms up a bit only if after heavy usage like gaming. This one heats up at times to the point of getting uncomfortable. However, it does get cooled down if you just close the apps.5 - 25W charging at this price is quite low but I understand. The heating issues of the previous models might have to do something with it.Hope my review will help you make an informed decision.

This phone is a pefect upgrade from my old One plus. I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that, processor used in s22 - Snapdragon 8 gen1 is inefficient (not to be confused with 8+ gen1, 8gen 1 is made by samsung foundary, 8+gen 1 is made by tsmc and works fine). So, snap 8gen1 is hot garbage. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. It's like putting a heating processor with a smaller battery. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby atmos mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing thing is, the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22 (only s22 ultra had vapor chamber). Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazeit.shop tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around ‚Çπ675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Cons -Screen has no dolby vision, its is limited to 16M colors instead of 1 Billion and is 1080p. Bluetooth codecs are limited to sbc, aac and ssc (samsungs seamless codec). So for HD audio you have to go with SSC, samsungs buds 2 Pro, since aptx won't work, although sonys Ldac can work. Inbuilt video player of samsung cannot play some audio formats like dolby truehd, or dts. Only AC3 or AAC are relevant.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours.Edit 4. - saw some people complaining about battery. Initially battery life will be about 5hrs, cause phone uses adaptive setting, means it learns usage patterns initially for few days(you could turn that off in battery settings). Also, there was a software bug with the keyboard always on, and consuming extra battery (it's been fixed). You should easily see 7-8 hours of battery life after that.

I wanted a compact phone with overall good performance and Camera. After months of Research I was thinking to go for Pixel 6a or 7a or Pixel 7 but none of the mobile in India did not had 256gb option I went for Samsung S23 256gb as I had got good exchange offer and discount. First few days I was worries about Battery but if we have Battery Protection option which will charge mobile till 85% it will not last a full day if we use much. So I started charging above 95% a d I am very much satisfied with Battery performance. But the biggest disappointment comes from the Camera Performance which is lacking Consistancy. Sometimes the photo looks so good with bright colours but many a times particularly when you are trying to capture a moving person the photos are very bad and many a times the photos looks stretched and the light glare issue as reported by many others is still seen. Sometimes the photos taken will look like painting with dark colors and it does not even look natural. Software wise Iam coming from Pixel 4a but still I don't miss it but when it comes to Camera the satisfaction which I had with Pixel 4a is lacking badly in my Samsung Galaxy S23. I hope Samsung will provide updates with major improvement in Camera as Software Updates will be provided for 4 years and I feel that too much focus was give on Ultra and the base S23 was missed to focus even though the Price of S23 is still high. If Camera is main focus do not go for S23. This is my first Flagship Device and I wanted to use my device atleast 4 to 5 years so Camera Update will be my major expectation from Samsung and Battery Performance should remain the same.

Bought 256GB variant for ‚Çπ73,500. Got same day delivery.Packaging could have been better. There were no bubble wraps. But the contents were intact.Now coming to the phone, since most people will be concerned about battery life, I will start with that, there is no need to worry. It comfortably lasts for a full day, provided that you are mostly on Wi-Fi. I have added screenshots of battery stats. For the first 3 stats the phone was connected to Wi-Fi for about 80% of the time. For the last one phone was on mobile data for 90% of the time. The phone takes around 1hr 15 mins to charge when using a 20 watt power adapter.Other aspects of the phone are also superb, like camera, smoothness of the UI. I hope Samsung doesn‚Äôt mess that up with software updates.PS: I am using the Ringke Fusion-X  case with the phone.

Every review that you have seen about this phone is true to quite an extent.Great camera, good features, and premium quality and is the perfect size for me. I would prefer a 6"" phone but that's the best you can get. It's a little on the heavier side but it doesn't really matter if you are using headphones.The cons:1 - Battery drains really fast. The reviews I saw did not warn about it. This is my biggest grudge, having gone a bit over budget.2 - Samsung's boring UI. BTW I never imagined I would buy a Samsung product. But seeing the comparos with iPhone 14, I felt I should give it a go. One Plus, for instance, gives a swipe option to go back to the previous page. Samsung still depends on the back button at the bottom of the phone. After using One Plus, this seems prehistoric and inconvenient. It would request Samsung if they make this small change.3 - For some weird reason, it takes very long to start. It's a costly phone. I do not expect it to be so slow4 - Again, the reviews I watched said it only warms up a bit only if after heavy usage like gaming. This one heats up at times to the point of getting uncomfortable. However, it does get cooled down if you just close the apps.5 - 25W charging at this price is quite low but I understand. The heating issues of the previous models might have to do something with it.Hope my review will help you make an informed decision.

This phone is a pefect upgrade from my old One plus. I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that, processor used in s22 - Snapdragon 8 gen1 is inefficient (not to be confused with 8+ gen1, 8gen 1 is made by samsung foundary, 8+gen 1 is made by tsmc and works fine). So, snap 8gen1 is hot garbage. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. It's like putting a heating processor with a smaller battery. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby atmos mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing thing is, the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22 (only s22 ultra had vapor chamber). Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazeit.shop tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around ‚Çπ675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Cons -Screen has no dolby vision, its is limited to 16M colors instead of 1 Billion and is 1080p. Bluetooth codecs are limited to sbc, aac and ssc (samsungs seamless codec). So for HD audio you have to go with SSC, samsungs buds 2 Pro, since aptx won't work, although sonys Ldac can work. Inbuilt video player of samsung cannot play some audio formats like dolby truehd, or dts. Only AC3 or AAC are relevant.Edit 1.

¬†The battery backup is very poor at present. Tried tweaking multiple things including changing the performance profile to ""Light"" instead of ""Standard"". That seems to help a bit. But, it's nowhere near the 7-8 hours of screen on time reported in most Youtube reviews and user experience.My old device was a Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro, which I exchanged for this. It had more than 100 apps installed and even with that the battery was pretty good. In this phone I have installed only a very few apps until now, so very surprised by the battery life.Many online forums including Samsung Members app have multiple reports of the same. Seems like its after the Feb 2023 update, hope it'll be fixed in their next update.(fingers crossed)Other than that it has been a very satisfying and really good experience with butter smooth animations and quick app loading, awesome screen and multimedia content from apps like Netflix is a treat to watch on it. And the ""Expert raw"" app is a beast at grabbing unprecedented level of detailing. Even if I use jpg output from it, it's still far ahead than the regular Camera app in it. However, the default camera app is also pretty solid. The camera images and videos in low light is pretty good.Another thing I liked is that most of the Samsung apps(that comes by default) which is not needed can be uninstalled.Note: One thing I learnt the hard way: If you're applying a screen guard/tempered glass afterwards, do register your fingerprint again for best detection.

Wow is definitely an understatement. Lavender. Such a nice device. Buttery Smooth UI, handy product. Decent camera. Just the right size. I was using poco f1 which was 6.2"". This phone is 6.1"". For me battery is not very good. But I just got it yday and am using it pretty heavy...getting used to it. Maybe over few days I'll get more backup. Still battery is pretty good for  3900mah.Apps are all pretty snappy. Am just confused abt Google apps vs Samsung apps. But am figuring it out . Haptic are also good. Not as customizable as MIUI. But it's pretty good. Some Samsung apps are kinda bloatware. So many new unfamiliar apps...other than that, everything  seems to be fine. Shall update.

The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.What's good about the device?1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.What's not so good?1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.When it happens, it's quite annoying.However, at the end of the day, I'm happy to have a compact and reliable phone with good network reception and excellent battery life!

Photocamera is excellent. Storage space is excellent. Battery life so-so. If you use it for gaming, or livestreaming battery goes off in less than half a day. Heats up outdoors even when you don't use it much. Has good screen brightness adaptability. Lightweight in hand. Not over the Moon with it though

I bought it a week ago.. i upgraded  from my oneplus 6, I used that phone for 4.5 yrs. I was confused between oneplus 11 and samsung 23, after thoroughly going through reviews from experts. I zeroed on this phone,.. I like the phone no doubt. The haptics are nice and UI is smooth.But i dont know why i m facing connectivity issues in this phone. Being a flagship phone, it should  have better connectivity.. but it sucks..websites do not open, both wifi and mobile networks have some kind of bug. I am unable to use internet, i have to constantlyrefresh and restart my device for better network. I am getting  missed calls alerts via sms although  mobile network shows full strength..I think samsung should look into this. its very irritating. Never faced this issue in my 4.5 yrs old oneplus 6.

I would say its the best ever compact flagship phone in the entire category of mobile.I had 2 choices in the same price bracket I.e.

Writing this review after 1 month of using this device. Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time.

Battery: on average use i got 14 to 15 hrs of Battery life and 6+ hrs of screen on time. Generally it would be sufficient for one day to use (morning to evening). [Okayish]Camera: its fantastic. Portrait mode at 3x is unbelievable i don't think even iphone can compete(Reference attached). Image processing is outstanding and you'll get tons of premium post editing features like object eraser etc. [No competition]Display: Its Samsung's Display so no comment needed. [Sexy dikhta h]In Hand feel: Bahut halka and grippy h. Premium feel aati h. Recently one of my friend bought iphone 14 pro we both found that very bulky and uncomfortable for long use. [best one hand friendly in market]Final verdict-: agar aapke mathe pe iphone k naam ka bhoot swar nhi h to S23 is a best deal for you. It has tons of premium practical features that no iphone can provide you. I accept people buy iphone for public appearance but if Samsung get that brand value then no iphone can compete S23.Edited: Superfast 5G support and very good HD call quality. No issues with mobile network found. Pop-up and Multi window (you can use as much apps as you can on one screen simultaneously) features are awesome. I am also adding SS of battery usages. Charging time from 0 to 100% is 1 hr 15 min.

Phone does the job, with all the features working as expected, camera has shutter lag, but samsung has told they will release the update related to camera ü§û, battery is decent for normal usage.

I felt screen size and battery could have been improved. Heats up after 15 mins of gaming. Not recommended for heavy phone users with more than 5 hours of SOT. Also, built-in Samsung apps hangs sometimes.

This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!

I bought the cream version and it looks very premium. Was in dilemma whether to buy Oneplus 11 which was costing around 55k. But got this gadget at 56k with exchange bonus which was icing on the cake.Coming to phone, the battery life is decent . I Get only around 5 hrs SOT /17 hrs  in total till battery life and I have very high usage like excel, chrome, and social media apps. Dont play games , so dont know the performance. But its buttery smooth .Outdoor brightness is exceptional. It is joy to watch videos on this on display.Camera is also excellent with very good portraits and night time shots with 60fps recording .Only con is slow charging , should have given 45 w charging option, 25W is slow and also the battery dies from 5% to 1% within like 5 mins.

Best Android phone yet. Everything is great except battery. Cameras, display, performance everything is super great but the battery lasts only 8-12 hrs max. I upgraded my android from Samsung M51 (7000mah battery) to this S23 (3900 mah battery) and I love everything except the battery in my new phone. Otherwise the phone is just great. OneUI latest version is also pretty good now. Go for it but beware of the battery!!

Camera too good. Display is dope af. Feels super nice to hold. Flagship experience all around. One small con is the camera arrangement, one below the other, hand touches the cam sometimes, will get used to it in a few days, plus and ultra won't have this issue because the size is bigger I guess. Battery is just decent but still way better than s22.Cam performance drops dramatically indoors or when light is low, even in the morning. Could use night mode to get better pictures. Relies a lot on post processing of the image. Sometimes images feels too HDRish without having hdr turned on. Pretty sure future updates could make the camera much better. In bright light both front and back cameras are amazing. 4k 60fps videos are too fiire, screenshots from video will look as good as standalone images. Ton of detail. Stabilization is excellent. Slo mo is fun too.

Its camera performance battery everything is great and it comes with a compact design. I had a doubt about the battery and its heating problem, but now there is nothing like that.It has all the features that should be in today's device, But for this you also have to pay a good amount.And it also delivers good value compared to last year's s22.So whoever wants to get a compact flagship smartphon, this is best option if he does not want to get an iPhone.

This is my first flagship Samsung device.  Prior to this I was using Samsung A52s. I also have a iphone 13. The size is almost exactly the same. If you examine closely, the body of the S23 feels a bit narrower. In my brief usage I am experiencing some heating but I think it will sort out after a few days.  Phone is definitely smooth even though I am restricting usage to lite mode. The haptic feedback is okay but not as remarkable as I was expecting after my usage of Nothing Phone 1 and iphone but its not bad either,I just had more expectation. I have received this phone after exchanging My A52s at ‚Çπ15,250/- and the exchange process of Amazon was much easier than what I have experienced with flipkart's exchange.Overall,I am quite satisfied with the purchase.

1. Very compact phone, if you switch from 6.5 inch to this you might feel this is small. Might take time to get adjusted to this.2. Battery life is good but not as excellent as claimed by reviewers. Install all your required apps and check the idle drain at Nighy, it's about 6%.3. Camera is excellent, both front and back. Low light photo is also good.4. The camera module is projecting out, so be careful during usage. Decent case should solve the issue.5. Screen display is very good6. Sound is awesome with dolby support7. Finger print sensor is slightly buggy, which might be fixed in updates.Exchange:1. Exchange process was so smooth. No hassle.After discount and Exchange effective price is 54k as of 1 March 2023

¬†I would love the camera quality 9f this phone. I am Attaching few photos which I took in one of the marriage in night.Talking about the Batterry- Easily one day with very heavy uses.Speed- snapdragon 8th gen 2 with extra clock is so much smooth and no lag in last 1 week. I have installed heavy games and my official apps as well. Till now it's like charm no si gle lag I have observed. Earlier was using one plus 9 and now jumped on to this device from one plus to flagship samsung. I can proudly that it was a wise decision.Charging speed is also very good. Your phone will take approx 1.3 hour to charge full. Ons- only one cons is no Charger with the phone  but you will get good discounts on cards so you can use thT for Charger. Other then that I am very happy with over all performance.

I liked almost every aspecf of this phone. It is premium,easy to hold considering the screen size ,reminds me of iPhone 5s but that was smaller. Slick,  swift and perfectly configured. I might say that this phone looks even better than some of the iPhonesin the market (of course those are way more premium and well put together). I think Samsung got jt all right this time as the elegant flat back and a very neutral design in the front with perfectly matched camera and refresh rates and the chip..display and camera  have been the forte but they went one notch up by making the phone look and shine of quality .
"

Pros:Very handy to useGood cameraBetter battery lifeLooking very premiumCons:Finger print is not reading properly after the screen guard installation (Using spigen screen guard)

Yes you can take moon shots with this phone too.. The AI does the processing but still it's a moon shot. Battery backup is as sufficient for a compact phone like this. You can increase it with more restrictive settings like performance to lite and display refresh rate to 60Hz. But we don't spend this much money to restrict like this right? Without doing these things am still getting 1 whole day battery backup. Am a moderate user. Camera is awesome. Processing speed is great.Two things that I have to get adjusted after changing from OnePlus 6 is Fast charging and Headphone/Bluutooth audio output.

I would say this 8gen 2 in s23 is in iPhone category, it has superb battery life and everything that a phone can offer.

This phone is working v well. The biggest concern while ordering high value products online is the receiving of  genuine , unused products. Amazon is doing v well in this and can be trusted for ordering.

I am using Samsung brand more than 10 years and this is first time I see Samsung has improved a lot. No lags, superfast phone, superfast charging, super display, many features, best camera. That's why I said android iPhone üòÑJust one thing battery should be 4500mah for small size S23 that will last long. While using camera, battery drains superfast and mobile temperature goes up and up.

¬†Wish they made more phones like the s23!For people who like small and sleek phones this is an absolute must have!There will always be something that's a bit off in any premium phones but as far as my recollection for this device, there's nothing such (for me atleast).The design, the camera (AND THE CAMERA PLACEMENTS!!!!!), the processor, the battery, the super fast charging, the ui and everything else about this phone is brilliance in itself. Samsung has really outdone itself in every department here and I love that a big brand really listens and makes devices that cater to an audience.  I did not have to think twice before getting this one. Way to go Samsung, you got me hooked!!!Edit: Night photography and astrophotography is just ü´∂

Upgraded from Samsung M33. Samsung UI, small size, SD 8 Gen 2, Awesome display, Pro grade camera biggest USPs in the phone. Battery life is average. But cant complain as its just 3900 mAh. Turn on adaptive battery, power saving routine during sleep AOD off, will easily last for 6 hours SOT. Fast and responsive. Even on light performance mode where processing is limited to about 70%, its quick and no lag. 8 gb ram is very optimized.

Look is good,Phone is heating..!Will review again after few daysBattery the first charging is ON
"

Great CameraGreat displayGreat Battery Life - It will take about 1 week to  learn the usage pattern, after that battery life will see improvement. I tested with adaptive battery and light performance mode and 100% to 7% gave me 7h 40m sot using numerous apps and 1d 6h total with 2h 33m remaining.Once you properly opmitize the phone, you can get the most out of it. Played Genshin Impact and it was awesome and no heating issues as well.4 years of os updates and 5 years of security updates.

A compact phone that handles anything with ease.Loving the features and customizations offered at all levels in the software.A worthy upgrade!

The only good thing about this phone is its camera. Battery drains really fast which is not expected from a flagship phone.definitely not worth 80k
"

Cameras, Display, Build, In-hand feel, speaker, battery great.Fingerprint is also great without screen guard, with can cause problems.Battery is good for normal use, but while using camera it drains fast, point to remember.UI is very smooth, never saw frame drops.All this after using for 15+ daysWorth every penny, great if u get under 60k

Amazing phone from Samsung this time. Performance is superb and no heating issues. Battery performance is also improved, it will last you whole day with moderate use. Software is smooth and lag free. Camera is next level, night performance is very good. Compact size and easy to use. If you can get it within 60k then best deal in flagship category.Go for it.

The looks , feel and balance is perfect ! Performance satisfactory for the past 2 months. The phone however lacks a proper utilisation manual and therefore, I am certain 90% of the users are not exploiting the phone, much beyond 50 % ! A training manual is a must a hard copy or soft copy ! Though this is a common problem with all medium to high end smartphones!

Excellent performance..but sometimes heating issue arrived..90min take for full charge with Samsung 45watt super fast charger..Camara quality good but not like iphone 14..i buy this with good exchange price rs 57,000/-..8gb 256 variant..
"

Don't buy if you play heavy games. It's not a gaming phone. Rest of the phone is pure magic. The size, camera, audio, battery, performance, everything. You won't be able to go back to a large phone after this.
"

Baught 256gb under 50k after exchanging my phone. Awesome phone.I don't see significant improvement in camera with older generation. But It is most secure Android phone with lots of feature such as ultrasonic fingerprint and with samsung wallet you do not need to carry your physical document or plastic money with you.
"

heating issue is prime, battery drains fast.
"

No complaints so far. Awesome battery and fabulous camera. The phone looks and feels premium.Pro tip: The exchange program with Amazon is much more hassle free and smooth. So if you are planning to exchange ur phone, go with Amazon rather than Flipkart, if you have the option.

After using Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for quite a bit as a daily driver and coming back to Samsung after a long time after using other smaller form factor phones like ONEPLUS 9, here's what I think about this phone.PROS:- This phone has the best camera ever installed into a smartphone, hands-down! No other phone made in human history can ever come close to 1% of what Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's cameras can do.- Performance is crazy! Not only it has Snapdragon 8Gen-2, but that too custom-made for Samsung Galaxy phones. You can play any games, run any apps and do whatever you'd want from a phone that is used at work, gaming, taking photos/videos and for personal use at the same time.- Rectangular form factor of this phone makes it so much comfortable and easy to hold. And it looks very premium too, which obviously is expected from a phone that costs this much.- OneUI has so many great features that they cannot be listed in one place. It brings a whole new meaning to ""smart"" in smartphones. Previously only Apple was making real smartphones that were actually smart and now with OneUI 5.1, Samsung has joined the league and probably done a better job than Apple at this point.- Good Lock modules + OneUI 5.1 has such a tremendous level of customization in terms of many aspects of the usability. It doesn't have all of it, to which I'll come in ""CONS"" section.- Charging time is good, reverse charging and wireless charging are such a sweet add-on that helps and makes the experience really good.- S-Pen does the wonders! Very useful specially for those who use their phone for professional work like eSigning and other precision work.- Build quality and software are really premium, you'll know you've sold a kidney when you hold this phone in your hands and turn up the max resolution on display.- S23 Ultra is slightly more flat on sides as compared to S22 Ultra which makes it a more usable phone.CONS:- Now, since this phone has a curved display which adds no usability but makes it little difficult to use for people with smaller hands or to reach to corners with one hand, it becomes little hard to get used to this kind of display even if you've used a curved display phone with smaller form factor before because S23 Ultra is HUGE!- Another issue with curved screen, since there's a decent curve in screen, finding a screen protector is really hard! Tempered glasses don't fit well, they get spaced by covers/cases, Samsung officially doesn't make tempered glass for S23 Ultra. Samsung sells a thin membrane sheet for ‚Çπ1,500/- which has a cutout for camera and collects dust. Having no screen protection means having your second kidney at risk too!- No charger in the box (ugh) and the cable that comes with it is really flimsy. Doesn't look like it came with a flagship phone. ONEPLUS makes 10x better cables so better buy one from them.- A phone this expensive should have all the necessary features right? But the OneUI 5.1 doesn't come with an app lock. Samsung Secure Folder is nice but not usable for a day-to-day use. Secure Folder is fine for hiding images and apps but not convenient for daily access. There's no Good Lock module to have app lock either.- OneUI 5.1 (unlike many other UIs like OxygenOS 13 and ColorOS 13) doesn't give option to rename apps in app drawer. Ability to use 3rd party icon packs just came recently. And installing a 3rd party launcher kind of ruins the UI for recent apps screen.- OneUI 5.1 requires installation of a 3rd party Good Lock module to even configure what icons will appear on your navigation bar.- Overall this is a really good phone, best I'd say! But OneUI 5.1 lacks some basic features which should've been implemented.- But other than these minor software issues and some hardware inconveniences, this phone is definitely a recommendation.

Pros : Screen, Camera.Cons :1) Speaker Loudness. Even my old Poco M4 Pro which costs only like 14k, sounds much much louder than this. And this phone also has a ""FAKE"" Dolby Atmos feature.I said fake, because just try playing a song with Dolby Atmos Enabled & Disabled & it will have ZERO effect on the song. I tried to increase the loudness using 3rd party volume boosters but it did not work.I don't know why Samsung used such inferior speakers in their highest end flagship phone. iPhone 14 Pro Max would have been 10-20 times more louder. Even my ages old iPhone 5S sounds louder with only a single speaker.2) No Charger in the box, No Screen Protector & Back Cover etc. Have to buy everything separately & it's a hell of a task to get a good screen protector for this phone. With this Price tag, Samsung could easily give a 25W Charger also but they decided to give only a charging cable which can't even support 45W Super Fast Charging 2.0 which this phone supports. Oh yeh I forgot that, they also gave a hugely demanding Sim card ejector lol.@Samsung, Please do one thing. Charge 2-3 Lacs for your phones & only send the phones in the box, no need to give the cable & the sim ejector too, because if we can buy the charger, screen protector & back covers separately after paying such huge amount for the phone, then we can also buy a good quality cable & sim ejector.3) Samsung also falsely claiming the battery capacity as 5000 mAH but in reality it's 4855 mAH as reported by all the battery apps like Ampere app which you can download from the PlayStore. And the battery is only Li-Ion & not Li-Polymer which should have been given by Samsung at this price point. Li-Ion batteries will keep demeriting over time but Li-Polymer batteries generally last much longer.. Battery is life also poor. Does not last a full day with moderate usage.4) Samsung also claims that this phone supports IP68 water & dust resistant but they have mentioned on their official site, not to submerge the phone into water & that this phone can lost the resistance to water over time with general wear & tear. iPhone 14 Pro Max on the other hand can be submerged into water up-to 30 meters, which gives that phone much better protection against water specially if we mistakenly drop the phone into water & water makes it way into the phone by any chance.5) Removed 1 more Star as Type C to 3.5 mm converters DO NOT WORK even though these are working properly with all my older phones from other companies, so you can't use any of your 3.5 mm headphones with this phone & you will have to buy a Type C to 3.5 mm converter with DAC from a reputed company, which will again cost more than 1000-2000 extra.Samsung has intentionally disabled support for 3rd party converters because they want you to buy the converter from them too.Overall, not satisfied after spending such huge on the phone & then having to spend thousands of more rupees for all the accessories  & getting low sounding speakers.

I got this phone just before making an international Trip. The phone served me really well. It's been super smooth and I've received a lot of compliments for my photos (Hey maybe that's also some part due to my skill, yes?).But the phone has a great battery life, quite often I'd come back home with around 50% battery (with BT and Loc on).  Mostly not with Power Saver on, but I did keep it on on some days initially.I hardly use the S-pen, mostly due to no habit, but it seems a cool addition for those with smaller hands. For me, I have giant Hands, so i can easily use the entire phone with my two hands.I would recommend this phone if you are looking for a premium product. The specifications obviously show a significant difference between the Ultra and the normal Samsung S23.

And found that it was good phone but no call recorder,  and it's camera was best then I compared my pixel with S23ultra and found there was not that much difference yes pixel camera was a bit good but I am not that professional or like that but found that apart from camera everything else is best in samsung s23ultra ..Also there was in built "" Call recorder "" which I always needed and that was main point where pixel was lagging behind .... and also found samsung galaxy s23ultra way more fast and efficient than pixel also there was no heating issue like pixel in this samsung galaxy s23 ultra....also I was never apple fan and never found it worth compared samsung, used apple 14 ,apart from camera where there may be difference of 0.5% between samsung and apple camera apple is over hyped and not a value for money phone and also you can't run multiple apps in background in apple and no call recorder also there is no back button or symbol in apple it's random some times you swipe it sometime some app has cross symbol in any corner that you have to search....better go for samsung it's always value for money. This review is not paid I have used all three master phones apple 14 pro, pixel and now samsung s23ultra....found S23 ultra to be the winner.

A smart phone thats worth the hype. Beats the competition with its features. I'm expecting some features to be fine tuned in future updates.

I'm in love with the quality of images clicked on this phone. As a traveler, it comes very handy to click pictures instantly. 10X on this phone is the best thing ever. I am able to click amazing bird shots which makes it hard for people to believe that those are captured on phone. Battery life is outstanding.Only thing I am not that satisfied with this phone is not a great focus when you get close to subject, macro shots aren't that great compared to iphone 14 pro. Rest everything just perfect.

I am not an avid phone user, for me this one is way beyond what I really need from a phone, its artificial but yea you can capture moon, its fun to see how the AI detects moon and artificially replace the moon image. camera is outstanding, performance is mind blowing never have to even think of the word hang, battery is awesome for my usage almost 2 days, only drawback(not a drawback in fact) is its big.

When it comes to the Galaxy S23 Ultra's outstanding capabilities, the camera is merely the tip of the iceberg. The gadget is really quick and has a potent CPU that can easily handle even the most taxing programmes and games. With its spectacular 6.8-inch Dynamic display, which offers stunning images and vivid colours that make everything from streaming video to browsing the web enjoyable, the device is truly stunning.

Samsung doing great things with s23 ultra, best choice to purchase this phone
"
265,"
This mobile is expensive but comes with lot of features too. I don't like few things, when purchasing such costly mobile and not get the extra goodies feels bad. No travel adapter, no buds,no jack for wire headphones. Disappointing. Some people like me are first time buyers for fast charging.

Very good phone as we can expect this at the price, S pen will give u a very higher feeling, camera, display, sound all are too good. I brought it at Rs. 109000/- after exchanging my broken oneplus display wala phone at 5000 + 10000 extrq discount. Actually price they are gaking now is too much, after an year it will drop down a lot, so my suggestion will be, if u can wait, then you can buy at a very lower price.

+ unmatched S-Pen that is useful+ Fantastic camera - best I have experienced+ Green is not my favorite color but on S23 ultra it looks awesome. Premium finish+ Big and beautiful display with thin bezels and tiny front camera hole. Great choice for OTT+ feels good and light in hand+ 5G with strong network connectivity+ Samsung UI is clean, no bloatware, Ads, and bugs.  Good customization options+ PERFORMANCE is best+ Samsung watch, earbuds, etc works well together- High price. SAMSUNG MUST MAKE THIS AFFORDABLE. At may be 80K sales can be more than 10 times- Strong competition offering better value (like 80% features at 50% price)

I am already using a s23 and bought this one because of all the praise it's receiving. Have to say that the reviews are almost right about this phone. But I honestly feel that for half the price, vanilla s23 is a far more value for money product than this one. If you like or even okay with smaller phones, s23 just makes more sense. I bought the s23 for 46k after exchanging 3 month old moto edge 30 and s23 ultra for 87k after exchanging 4 month old pixel 6a. One thing I can assure you is that one ui is addictive

After around 4.5 years of extensive one plus 6T usage, finally I decided go for a new phone and did a pre-booking of Samsung s23 ultra.Here I am writing this review with no regrets on my decision ever. Very happy with the one UI experience, super smooth OS and performance, extensive battery life ,unbeatable camera quality, Display and gaming experience. Just go for it guys if you don't have a budget barrier.

Bought it after replacing S22 ultra trusted samsung one more time with this so far its good ...the biggest complain of 22Ultra  i.e. battery life is no longer in this one...Photos also looks quite impoved since 22Ultra..Edit :- battery life is crazy good 10 hours of SOT with Quad Hd resolution and 120Hz and dark theme my S22 ultra was at 30% just after 5 hrs of SOT loving it will use 23 ultra atleast for 3 years

I am coming from s20 fe 5g, everything feels like an upgrade, the screen, the build,  the display, the battery, the speakers. The only think that is still taking time to get used to is the size of it, it's a huge phone, wished it was a tad smaller to like 6.3inch and it would have been in a sweet spot for one hand use. This is the phone to last for several years to come without needing any upgrades.

You can buy it if you can afford it but be sure to protect it as it comes with hefty price. If you are coming from iPhone and want to copy all photos then do it at the time of setting up. I found the battery is regular if we clone iPhone data. If we setup as a fresh phone then it may give good battery life.
"

Always wondered when samsung will ditch Exynos for Snapdragon for Flagship phones, and finally Snapdragon for Galaxy, no over heating and better optimised phone, battery last almost 36 to 48 hours with normal usage,  I miss the curve edge but it has his own advantage but rest features compensate enough...Thanx Sammy n Amz for the beasty product

Upgraded from my galaxy note 9 and I am liking the performance. The camera is easily the highlight of this phone. It takes stunning photos and videos. The ultra series has kept the legacy of the note series alive by keeping the s-pen and bringing the best hardware in the market. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a flagship device with best on the market hardware

I ordered this on 1-Jul Sat day and got it delivered in few hours time. Delivery was super fast. However , the phone is having issues - the call volume sound is too low, I can barely hear other side talking in home..in traffic it's almost impossible. The charging port has issue, if we move the wire slightly during charging, it will stop charging. In the car also, android auto disconnects with slightest bump. Raised a request for product replacement,  they assigned technical inspection. IIt was supposed to be done at home physically, however the technician called on phone, asked to I stall a inspection software ND said he will provide the report to Amazon. I received notification from Amazon and the call the customer service today only to know that the technician marked the issue as resolved. I was very surprised to know this. I logged a complaint with Amazon customer care, they now asked to wait for 48 hours and they will call back, so waiting..will update in this review once I hear back, hoping it will resolved properly.All in all, not a good experience so far with this purchase, one lesson learnt is not to buy high-end phones in Amazon anymore, it's very agonizing..yesterday I visited a nearby Samsung cafe and the gentleman also said not to buy high-end phones online. FYI..

It's been 7 days since I started using it. In this 1 week my experience with Lava Blaze 5G was more bad than good. Although it wasn't worse as some might think. So, let's start the review from where it needs to be.Delivery and Unboxing- The package I received was really the worst in my entire life. There was only the amazon cardboard box but that's it. It was very wore out, loose and completely opened from one side. On top of that there was no foam, bubble wrap or thermocol sheet at all to protect from accidental shocks or any damage. At first impression it felt like my package has been tampered but thankfully that's not the case. I would request amazon to improve their packaging and I would like to ask about why their packaging quality got degraded over the years. I didn't pay 12k rupees to just receive whatever garbage you can give me. It was an entire months hard earned money. When I started unboxing it everything was there safe and sound. Now I took a sigh of relief. What made me more happy was after setting up the phone I saw the battery was 56%. Every phone I bought till now used to have 49% or below. This is the first ever phone that gives 56% out of the box. Even more exciting thing was this phone gives clean Android with no bloatware and limited features too. But let me inform you that this is not Stock Android. It just uses Google apps and doesn't have any mp3 player, video player or even a gallery of it's own. I wonder if they really have to give only Google apps then they could've provided Google Gallery. Also Lava is using a custom skin but it was hidden so brilliantly that you can't find it even if you wanted to. The customization features of Blaze 5G proved that.Battery and Charging- 2nd thing about this phone that impressed me. After unboxing it I charged it upto 79% only and did normal tasks like watching Amazon prime, using Google, phone calls, SMS, WhatsApp etc and after 43 hours and 31 minute the battery was 14%. I really was shocked to see this. Imagine how much time it would take to fully deplete the battery. Also, what could've happened if I charged the phone to 100%. But let me tell you it's not because of the enormous 5000mAh battery. This great backup is only because of Lava using Mediatek Dimensity 700 and how well they optimised the battery. Also the clean Android plays a huge role too as there are no apps that will suck the battery in background. Additionally, the 720x1600p display is also another reason for it as it will do less processing compared to a Full HD+ display. That's why it will consume less power. But in gaming I will say it's same as any other phone. Battery will deplete faster and it also depends on what games you play. They give you a 12W charger in the box but the Lava Customer Care confirmed me that Blaze 5G supports upto 15W charging. So if you already have a 15W charger in home you can easily fast charge it. The 12W charger takes more than 3 hours for charging 0 to 100%. Using a 15W charger will make it a bit faster. Expect upto 2 hours for fully charging with a 15W charger.Display- This phone has a 6.52 inch, 720x1600 (HD+) 90Hz IPS LCD panel, 20:9 aspect ratio with ~269ppi. But don't be disappointed by hearing the resolution numbers. I had seen IRL it feels same as any 1080p display. There is no pixelation, no sluggish-ness and picture quality is great. 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone feel very fast too. Also, the display is very clear in direct sunlight outside. In general the phone is somehow having more nits than anyone else. Just decrease your brightness to the lowest and you'll see that Blaze 5G is still bright than other phones of any price you say. Now this was oddly satisfying to me.CPU and Performance- This phone uses a Mediatek Dimensity 700, 6GB RAM and Mali-G57 MC2 GPU. I has been gaming on this phone since the day I received it and it really impressed me in gaming. I play Eversoul, Brawl Stars, T3 Arena, Asphalt 9, The 7 Deadly Sins Grand Cross, Sword Art Online: Integral Factor and Tasokare Hotel. Eversoul, Asphalt 9 and T3 Arena are actually heavy games and will make your phone heat in no time. They do lag on budget phones and perform badly. But playing these games on Blaze 5G was wonderful. They run really very smooth and have no lags, jitters or any frame drops at all and I play entire day but the temps of this phone never reached 40¬∞. It reached maximum 36¬∞-37¬∞ till now. I really loved how Lava worked on the thermals and it doesn't warm at all and always stays at room temps. Let me tell you that just opening Eversoul makes my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G overheat like crazy. It takes only 1-2 minute to get 58.9¬∞. Yes, I switched to Lava Blaze 5G from a 37k S20 FE 5G and that too because of overheating, thermal throttling and even though S20 FE 5G is equipped with a Snapdragon 865 but it still lags while gaming. Some games has started crashing recently too on it. Thankfully Blaze 5G doesn't have any issues and is very stable. I really loved Blaze 5G giving the option of virtual memory too. But let me tell you that virtual memory is only useful for devices under 4GB of RAM. It won't be any helpful for 6GB and above RAM so I had disabled it after first boot. On top of that you will lose a chunk of your storage unnecessarily. I will suggest everyone to use your Blaze 5G with virtual memory disabled. The memory management in this phone has been another impressive thing. If you minimize the apps or games and open it after 30 minutes, it will resume from where you left and didn't reload. Where my more expensive S20 FE 5G sometimes reloads the apps and games.Audio- This phone gave me mixed feelings in the matter of audio. Playing music with YT music will feel something else, playing music with Google Files will make you feel something else and facebook, WhatsApp or YouTube will give another kind of feeling. Sometimes it can sound hollow, sometimes it will sound suppress but sometimes it will sound great. It depends on what app you're using and if the music is a mp3 file or you're streaming online. The presence of 3.5mm jack was really impressive too. You can use Bluetooth Neckband, TWS earbuds, 3.5mm earphones and Type-C earphones. I have used pTron Bassbuds Duo, KDM A-2 neckband and Core Type-C earphones. It support it all. A really great thing that you can't get in 200k 300k rupees phone. I really enjoyed the multi support for audio. Otherwise the lack of 3.5mm jack is becoming very normal in budget phones too.Camera- The photos and videos are exactly what made me hate this phone. This phone comes with Triple Camera AI Setup. Primary one is 50 Megapixels, 2nd module is a 2 Megapixels Macro and 3rd one is not mentioned anywhere but when I asked the Lava Customer Care they told me it is a 0.2 Megapixel VGA module. There is no depth sensor or telephoto lens. A lot of people will dislike this setup but it was good for me as I don't use the telephoto very often. Both the photos and videos are very bad. Sharpness is what a budget phone will give you but there is no HDR, perfect white balance, and while shooting in broad daylight it will overexpose everything. It extremely overexposed my indoor lighting too and I use only 1 CFL bulb for each room. Take this statement as a fact that this camera module will overexpose even a single photon. Let alone broad daylight situation. The colors will be a bit washed out too. I took a photo of my Hero Sprint cycle which is red color but the photo was showing light red/orange-ish color. Software updates of Lava is like non-existent so no idea when we will receive one but these canera issues can be fixed by a software upgrade for sure. But let me tell you that even though Lava advertised Blaze 5G can shoot 2K EIS but that's not the exact matter. You can use EIS in 480p recording too. I have done that and I still don't know if it's a bug or feature but I had shot footages of 480p non-eis, 480p eis, 720p non-eis, 720p eis, 1080p non-eis, 1080p eis, 1440p non-eis and 1440p eis. Glad they didn't lock the EIS function to only 2K. I have attached all the photos so you can take a good look at how both the front and rear camera perform at day and night.Connectivity- Again it impressed me and this time it was in the matter of connectivity. I have used both of my airtel 5G SIM AND THIS PHONE RUNS DUAL 5G ü§©ü§©ü§© I was able to use mobile data from both of these SIM cards and I was getting the expected 5G speed. It also runs dual 4G and dual 3G too. Something that even the extremely high priced phones like Samsung S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 series and 15 series don't provide at all but this Lava 5G did it and it really performs flawlessly. WiFi didn't have any disconnection issues at all and the Bluetooth was able to transfer 4GB of data a little bit faster which I never expected. Lava has played some serious games here with the dual 5G and such capable Bluetooth module. Hotspot didn't face any issues too. Sharing files over both hotspot and Nearby Share was flawlessly fast. Kudos to Lava for providing a connectivity that challenges phones (not so) worth of lakhs.Final Verdict- So... Should you buy this phone or not? I will say yes and will recommend it but it also depends from person to person. It was very depressing to see that they don't have any service center in Bhubaneswar, Odisha too. Thankfully they compensated this by providing home service so an agent of their will come to your home and will fix everything but if something serious is found, then they'll take the device to service center. Overall this device outstands everything and I have seen a test where Blaze 5G beats S22 Ultra in 5G speed test. So undoubtedly a great device but it is having a huge headroom for improvements.Thank you and have a nice day üòä

Recently I was visited by a close friend, who also  had a Lava blaze 5G mobile,I never used a Lava gadget and so bit taken aback,but to my surprise he was all praise for most of its functions.I than gone through some users and experts views and  decided to buy. Pros a mobile needs to be presenablle  and comfort to hold and work without much of fuss.On this count it  is a PASS.Now  what surprise me  that a Android  13 upgrade was on the card.this thrilled me  immensely as Lava was silent on this aspect.A minimum of 2-3 upgrades on Android are a must.Processor I also  working well. 5G Speed was at par with other mobiles in this price bracket.Infact this is the cheapest 5Gvset which is holding its Head high. looks are average.In Cons  battery charge is slow which if provided with a fast Charging would have enhanced it's utility.All future mobiles without this enhanced utility would have been most welcome.My comments are keeping with its price bracket.All in all I am at peace with this buy Well done LAVA,you have done it

Good points:It's been almost 2 months since I purchased this phone. It's been running good for most notmal use cases. I use my mobile phone for calls, work (emails/chats/video calls), browsing, social media, & watching videos & podcasts. Am not into gaming. But for my day-to-day use the battery lasts for the whole day, 5G reception has been problem-free, UI/UX has been decent so far. Build quality is good - despite of falling on floor on some occasions, no issues (ofc, I have put it in a mobile  case & have got armoured glass to protect the screen)!Limitations:Volume, when you put your phone on speaker mode, is bit low.. esp in noisy env.Also felt the camera quality could have been better.

Very good choice for entry level 5G phone. Charging cable is very low quality, Charger is average quality, but works decently. Average quality back cover case is also provided.Camera quality is average.UI is clean and now Android 13 update is also available (Already updated).Sometimes network issue (shows good network in status bar but at backend no network), which doesn't resolve on starting and stopping the Airplane mode. For this you have to restart the device.Overall good performance, gets a bit heated while using WiFi for a long period.

It's been 7 days since I started using it. In this 1 week my experience with Lava Blaze 5G was more bad than good. Although it wasn't worse as some might think. So, let's start the review from where it needs to be.Delivery and Unboxing- The package I received was really the worst in my entire life. There was only the amazon cardboard box but that's it. It was very wore out, loose and completely opened from one side. On top of that there was no foam, bubble wrap or thermocol sheet at all to protect from accidental shocks or any damage. At first impression it felt like my package has been tampered but thankfully that's not the case. I would request amazon to improve their packaging and I would like to ask about why their packaging quality got degraded over the years. I didn't pay 12k rupees to just receive whatever garbage you can give me. It was an entire months hard earned money. When I started unboxing it everything was there safe and sound. Now I took a sigh of relief. What made me more happy was after setting up the phone I saw the battery was 56%. Every phone I bought till now used to have 49% or below. This is the first ever phone that gives 56% out of the box. Even more exciting thing was this phone gives clean Android with no bloatware and limited features too. But let me inform you that this is not Stock Android. It just uses Google apps and doesn't have any mp3 player, video player or even a gallery of it's own. I wonder if they really have to give only Google apps then they could've provided Google Gallery. Also Lava is using a custom skin but it was hidden so brilliantly that you can't find it even if you wanted to. The customization features of Blaze 5G proved that.Battery and Charging- 2nd thing about this phone that impressed me. After unboxing it I charged it upto 79% only and did normal tasks like watching Amazon prime, using Google, phone calls, SMS, WhatsApp etc and after 43 hours and 31 minute the battery was 14%. I really was shocked to see this. Imagine how much time it would take to fully deplete the battery. Also, what could've happened if I charged the phone to 100%. But let me tell you it's not because of the enormous 5000mAh battery. This great backup is only because of Lava using Mediatek Dimensity 700 and how well they optimised the battery. Also the clean Android plays a huge role too as there are no apps that will suck the battery in background. Additionally, the 720x1600p display is also another reason for it as it will do less processing compared to a Full HD+ display. That's why it will consume less power. But in gaming I will say it's same as any other phone. Battery will deplete faster and it also depends on what games you play. They give you a 12W charger in the box but the Lava Customer Care confirmed me that Blaze 5G supports upto 15W charging. So if you already have a 15W charger in home you can easily fast charge it. The 12W charger takes more than 3 hours for charging 0 to 100%. Using a 15W charger will make it a bit faster. Expect upto 2 hours for fully charging with a 15W charger.Display- This phone has a 6.52 inch, 720x1600 (HD+) 90Hz IPS LCD panel, 20:9 aspect ratio with ~269ppi. But don't be disappointed by hearing the resolution numbers. I had seen IRL it feels same as any 1080p display. There is no pixelation, no sluggish-ness and picture quality is great. 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone feel very fast too. Also, the display is very clear in direct sunlight outside. In general the phone is somehow having more nits than anyone else. Just decrease your brightness to the lowest and you'll see that Blaze 5G is still bright than other phones of any price you say. Now this was oddly satisfying to me.CPU and Performance- This phone uses a Mediatek Dimensity 700, 6GB RAM and Mali-G57 MC2 GPU. I has been gaming on this phone since the day I received it and it really impressed me in gaming. I play Eversoul, Brawl Stars, T3 Arena, Asphalt 9, The 7 Deadly Sins Grand Cross, Sword Art Online: Integral Factor and Tasokare Hotel. Eversoul, Asphalt 9 and T3 Arena are actually heavy games and will make your phone heat in no time. They do lag on budget phones and perform badly. But playing these games on Blaze 5G was wonderful. They run really very smooth and have no lags, jitters or any frame drops at all and I play entire day but the temps of this phone never reached 40¬∞. It reached maximum 36¬∞-37¬∞ till now. I really loved how Lava worked on the thermals and it doesn't warm at all and always stays at room temps. Let me tell you that just opening Eversoul makes my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G overheat like crazy. It takes only 1-2 minute to get 58.9¬∞. Yes, I switched to Lava Blaze 5G from a 37k S20 FE 5G and that too because of overheating, thermal throttling and even though S20 FE 5G is equipped with a Snapdragon 865 but it still lags while gaming. Some games has started crashing recently too on it. Thankfully Blaze 5G doesn't have any issues and is very stable. I really loved Blaze 5G giving the option of virtual memory too. But let me tell you that virtual memory is only useful for devices under 4GB of RAM. It won't be any helpful for 6GB and above RAM so I had disabled it after first boot. On top of that you will lose a chunk of your storage unnecessarily. I will suggest everyone to use your Blaze 5G with virtual memory disabled. The memory management in this phone has been another impressive thing. If you minimize the apps or games and open it after 30 minutes, it will resume from where you left and didn't reload. Where my more expensive S20 FE 5G sometimes reloads the apps and games.Audio- This phone gave me mixed feelings in the matter of audio. Playing music with YT music will feel something else, playing music with Google Files will make you feel something else and facebook, WhatsApp or YouTube will give another kind of feeling. Sometimes it can sound hollow, sometimes it will sound suppress but sometimes it will sound great. It depends on what app you're using and if the music is a mp3 file or you're streaming online. The presence of 3.5mm jack was really impressive too. You can use Bluetooth Neckband, TWS earbuds, 3.5mm earphones and Type-C earphones. I have used pTron Bassbuds Duo, KDM A-2 neckband and Core Type-C earphones. It support it all. A really great thing that you can't get in 200k 300k rupees phone. I really enjoyed the multi support for audio. Otherwise the lack of 3.5mm jack is becoming very normal in budget phones too.Camera- The photos and videos are exactly what made me hate this phone. This phone comes with Triple Camera AI Setup. Primary one is 50 Megapixels, 2nd module is a 2 Megapixels Macro and 3rd one is not mentioned anywhere but when I asked the Lava Customer Care they told me it is a 0.2 Megapixel VGA module. There is no depth sensor or telephoto lens. A lot of people will dislike this setup but it was good for me as I don't use the telephoto very often. Both the photos and videos are very bad. Sharpness is what a budget phone will give you but there is no HDR, perfect white balance, and while shooting in broad daylight it will overexpose everything. It extremely overexposed my indoor lighting too and I use only 1 CFL bulb for each room. Take this statement as a fact that this camera module will overexpose even a single photon. Let alone broad daylight situation. The colors will be a bit washed out too. I took a photo of my Hero Sprint cycle which is red color but the photo was showing light red/orange-ish color. Software updates of Lava is like non-existent so no idea when we will receive one but these canera issues can be fixed by a software upgrade for sure. But let me tell you that even though Lava advertised Blaze 5G can shoot 2K EIS but that's not the exact matter. You can use EIS in 480p recording too. I have done that and I still don't know if it's a bug or feature but I had shot footages of 480p non-eis, 480p eis, 720p non-eis, 720p eis, 1080p non-eis, 1080p eis, 1440p non-eis and 1440p eis. Glad they didn't lock the EIS function to only 2K. I have attached all the photos so you can take a good look at how both the front and rear camera perform at day and night.Connectivity- Again it impressed me and this time it was in the matter of connectivity. I have used both of my airtel 5G SIM AND THIS PHONE RUNS DUAL 5G ü§©ü§©ü§© I was able to use mobile data from both of these SIM cards and I was getting the expected 5G speed. It also runs dual 4G and dual 3G too. Something that even the extremely high priced phones like Samsung S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 series and 15 series don't provide at all but this Lava 5G did it and it really performs flawlessly. WiFi didn't have any disconnection issues at all and the Bluetooth was able to transfer 4GB of data a little bit faster which I never expected. Lava has played some serious games here with the dual 5G and such capable Bluetooth module. Hotspot didn't face any issues too. Sharing files over both hotspot and Nearby Share was flawlessly fast. Kudos to Lava for providing a connectivity that challenges phones (not so) worth of lakhs.Final Verdict- So... Should you buy this phone or not? I will say yes and will recommend it but it also depends from person to person. It was very depressing to see that they don't have any service center in Bhubaneswar, Odisha too. Thankfully they compensated this by providing home service so an agent of their will come to your home and will fix everything but if something serious is found, then they'll take the device to service center. Overall this device outstands everything and I have seen a test where Blaze 5G beats S22 Ultra in 5G speed test. So undoubtedly a great device but it is having a huge headroom for improvements.Thank you and have a nice day üòä

Recently I was visited by a close friend, who also  had a Lava blaze 5G mobile,I never used a Lava gadget and so bit taken aback,but to my surprise he was all praise for most of its functions.I than gone through some users and experts views and  decided to buy. Pros a mobile needs to be presenablle  and comfort to hold and work without much of fuss.On this count it  is a PASS.Now  what surprise me  that a Android  13 upgrade was on the card.this thrilled me  immensely as Lava was silent on this aspect.A minimum of 2-3 upgrades on Android are a must.Processor I also  working well. 5G Speed was at par with other mobiles in this price bracket.Infact this is the cheapest 5Gvset which is holding its Head high. looks are average.In Cons  battery charge is slow which if provided with a fast Charging would have enhanced it's utility.All future mobiles without this enhanced utility would have been most welcome.My comments are keeping with its price bracket.All in all I am at peace with this buy Well done LAVA,you have done it

I hope this problem could be solved by software update. 8mp selfi cam.. is also a good part selfi quality  good,detailed. Lawa needs also work on speaker part. Connectivity good 4g also work.

For a basic purpose with 5g connection and ok picture phone is ok. But if you don't going to use 5g you can go for lava 4g models like lava blaze 4g. In that Rate thare is no big complaints except heating issue. But if you having more budget and you use regular camera or doing video blogs I would say go for more strong processer. And yes for gaming also it's not a good one guys.

My samsung phone (M 31) suddenly stopped working at the end of the month, was in a tight budget so took a chance with Lava ... Can say frankly, I am not at all disappointed... Using it for last one month , working just fine ... Iv loaded so many apps still running smoothly...Pros:Value for money pricingFlagship lookDecent build qualityVibration and ring volume is loud enough90 Hz screen is smooth enoughExtremely good battery back up , mine was drained till 10% after 2 days of vigorous use.3.5 headphone jackOther required features are also good.Cons:No fast charging, it takes near about 2.5 hrs to charge is from 10%-100%. The highest input is 15 watt max . You will get a 10 watt charger along with it.The audio out put with the headphones are low and not that much good.Camera is ok for daily use but not at all 50 MP.my biggest disappointment is the secondary camera, it's 8 MP mentioned but performs really bad in low light conditions.Here is the detailed review of the product. Choose according to your needs. For this price or lower, it's value for money.

Happy to say that it's a good one. I really had low expectations on Lava but definitely it changed. It may not be great one, but really worth of money.1. UI is not that great, still there are gaps and scope to improve2. Battery is good and definitely above expectations3. Battery charging time is actually very long, it may be a negative. It takes aprx. 2.5 hrs to full charge4. Sound quality is good5. Camera is not great but not really bad. Good for those who does not use much camera etc.

Just go for it. It's bestest trully make in India product. It's HD display but really much better than lots of other Chinese brand FHD display. It's 6gb ram runs smoothly. My Airtel 5g works awesome. It's really best Indian product. Request every Indian to go for lava product . It's really nice product with best price. Infact this is my second, earlier bought for my father and then I bought for myself as wellJust go for it if you believe in make in India.

Pros* The battery  life is good.* fingerprint scanner is good* The glass and the build quality are good* No network issues (got about 620MBps 5G speeds)* Fairly good memory management* Anonymous call recording* youtube background streaming (can put phone on standby inside the bag and youtube keeps playing!!!)* so far good with Jio-True5G  [Please note that Vo-NR is still unavailable in Jio and Airtel is NSA]. The device on the other hand supports Vo-NR (says so in the signal status)cons:* The placement of fingerprint scanner means accidentally if vol-down and power is pressed it keeps taking screenshots. Also while holding the phone the fingerprint scanner gets activated* The speaker is placed at the bottom. If you lie down in the bed and keep it on your chest, the speaker gets blocked* Bit bulkyOverall: Very good phone for this price budget. Quite smooth and good to use.

I wanted to buy a budget 5g phone for my wife having  following criteria:-1. Superb design2. Good Ram and ROM3. Good camera if not Superb4. Good screen if not best5. No bloatware and stock android6. And finally, Good battery with day day performance as my wife don't play game.I am truly happy to share that this phone has exceeded my expectations in every corner. Actually, I was little skeptical about the screen as it is only HD plus, however to my surprise, it is best HD plus display I have every seen. Not much difference. Camera also exceeded my expectations, though little improvement is required in white exposure. And surprisingly,  it is from indian brand Lava. Long live Lava!! Keep doing great. I am owing samsung but I swear If Lava keeps doing this, my next phone will be from Lava. Everyone in my family and friends praised this. My true words.Few things which was a true surprise as I didn't expect at all in this price segment:-1. Haptics (best means best, even better than premium segment phones)2. Screen color reproduction is sometimes equal to that of Amoled, though not always. But believe me HD plus display will not be a regret.3. awesome Ram management and UFC 2.1 will definitely make your feel of using a premium phones4. Looks - not even 25 to 30k phone will come near to this.Though, some cons are also there-1. Slow charger - takes around 3 hours to charge battery, though battery backup is Superb.2. Video lags in 2k 60 FPS, though work fine in 1080 60 fps. This really requires efforts from Lava as it is possible to improve via update.3. Camera white exposure and portrait mode requires improvements.4. Background stream - in review videos, option of background stream like YouTube is shown, however in reality, I am unable to see this. Please get this done with an update.5. Last but not least - place of fingerprint sensor or power key sometimes feel uncomfortable for new user. Though, not an issue after some days use.If the above issues are possible to resolve, please resolve Lava.No phone can come close to this pure stock android experience in this price range.However, the way you have made a come back in indian market is Superb. All the best my indian company. Keep doing great.

We are using from 1 month. It's giving very high performance. It is giving more than expected. But there is need to improve the camera department. Sharpness is not their in the picture by camera. We are genuinely writing the review. Handling games very easily. 1000 times better than China mobiles. I'm using poco m4 5g but it is not better than lava blaze 5g. Lava is better ever and forever. We used 3 lava mobiles till now these mobiles gave maximum performance.

This phone is awesome! This is my first 5g enabled phone, and man, with 8gb Ram and all the cool features. It makes for an amazing deal.Yes, the camera may not be as clickalious as other costlier brands there. But hey, if you're looking for a performance phone, at this price this is the best deal out there.To sum it up, I just love it.

Posting this review after using Blaze 5G for 6 months. Overall my experience¬†is quite good. This was my 1st Lava phone, so initially I was hesitating¬†before purchase. It turned out to be much¬†much¬†better than my expectations. Few aspects where LAVA can improve is having its own apps like gallery,¬†file explorer etc. But currently, it has google apps for gallery¬†and files, and they work well on the system. Never saw the phone getting hanged, never faced any bugs/glitches.Somehow there is poor perception for¬†phones of Indian brands that they can't be as good as Chinese/Korean phones, but LAVA is agressively correcting this wrong perception. Now LAVA played really well by providing an upgrade to Android 13 on this august! So happy about this, it's really cool.

I was a bit reluctant to buy a phone from Lava as earlier they used to be cheap Chinese knockoffs. But this phone was a pleasant surprise.The best thing about this phone is that there are no advertisements (annoying notifications) or bloatware. Stock Android would have been an icing on the cake, but it is good enough. At less than 13K a 5G device with 8 GB RAM and 128 GB storage is already more than expected. Finally the processor is good enough for day to day use. I don't play games.

Touch is fine, internet connectivity is fine. Pricewise good but fingerprint is too sensitive. Screenshot taking is little difficult. Hanging starts a very early stage. You have lock & unlock to resolve it.

This is best value for money 5G phone.  Overall, the phones feel premium.  Camera is above average and so overall good and it is by default tunned especially for low light photos. However, one can use pro mode to adjust exposure to some extent. At times for some modes, you may see pixelation. The macro shots taken in Sunlight are highly exposed. The long shots in day and night are good. Video has EIS, Slow motion and Time Lapse and screen recording options.  Music Sound, Call quality and call recording is decent. Display is overall good.  Almost pure android 12.  I could test Airtel 5G and Reliance Jio 5G on this phone and I got speed upto 300 mbps on Airtel 5G and 500 mbps speed on Reliance Jio 5G. So, the phone is 5G ready out of the box. Duel port charger is provided.Further improvements expected:-Need wireless FM.-Need camera tunning to adjust exposure to Sun light in all modes-Need more PPI.-Side buttons and senser position and button length is a little problem when attaching phone on the Tripod.-Double tap screen wake up / off missing- Need more gesture control options-Key board sensitivity is inconsistent for some applications and in web-based form fill in-Application like BHIM loads bit slower-Need Gorilla glass.Overall, very good efforts by an Indian company ""Lava"". I recommend this phone as long as it holds price upto12K.

Good 5G phone at this price.Using with airtel and Jio SIM and quite good speed (Compared with same SIM and other 5G phone).Battery backup is quite good .Even with using as hotspot for 10 hours ,still having around 30% battery left.Good voice clarity.Camera ok type.Moreover an Indian brand and a challenger to chinese brands.

I'm writing review after using phone 7 days it's Indian product and most thing no heating problem as like Chinese mobile if you talk by Chinese mobile you feel heating in ear so you have to make speaker on but same is not in lava battery long last for 3 days speaker voice very good screen refresh rate good camera not up to mark but in 12k price it's very good Indian 5G mobile no heating during charging and on long use.better quality then Chinese brand so everyone has to go for this Indian brand

Mobile phone not bad within this price, however complaints are, screen scratch gaurd not provided, front camera flash light not available, fingerprint scanner should be on back side identify where this phone has at power button and not acceptable, difficulty in touching the button through mobile case, simcard slot provided is not good and not standerd, poor quality, can place 2 sim cards but no memory card or can place only one sim card 1 or 2 with memory card which is not acceptable, also the mobile case provided does not have camera protection, the whole camera portion in mobile case is open, sound quality is best, c type cable provided, is ok but need to have a common USB type cable connection to all mobile phones, one usb slot available where in some other YouTube mobile revies, 2slots of usb connectios provided, this is confusing, 50 mp camera provided biut does not seems to be 50 mp. Front camera 8mp this also ok but does not have that much quality compaired to other 8 mp camera, front camera flash light should be there while taking the photos or vedios, these all mentioned facts need to be improve.The important part is about Amazon delivery which is not acceptable. Inspite of being prime member, still there was a delay in delivery and took three days, poor Amazon customer services, the same repeated standard reverts to everyone, no empathy, sympathy and special treatment to prime members also for early delivery, Amazon is cheating the customers inviting to become prime members, not acceptable from Amazon. Excuses given by Amazon services are also not genuine and are working like robots better place reboots to give the same standard reverts to customers.Over all 3 - 3 1/2 points out of 5 and 0 for amazon services

In this price giving 50mp camera, glass back, Large IPS LCD display with 90Hz, best 5g chipset with all bands and best connectivity in any location, this is something everyone can not able to do. The premiumness of it is awesome it doesn't feel cheap while holding. And overall camera experience of its camera really good. It takes nice shots, potrait and selfies and software is the best part of it because it's very clean and smooth. It's the best phone you can buy in this segment.

I didn't expected it from lava but after holding phone in my hands I can say that lava is on right path. Phone quality is just awesome. Design is pleasing. Software and smoothness of phone is on next level. It can't be a 12000 phone. I am ready to pay 15-16000 for this type of device. Really feel proud by buying this phone. Hope more to come in future from lava with this type of quality and features.Battery and software is very goodDesign and Build quality awesomeCamera goodMade in india very good.Well done lava. Keep it up. We are here to support you. Proudly indian.

1. This phone doesn't have Front flash for camera. (That's the basic need you have not given).2. Phone is consuming too much battery even though I have not installed many apps. (My previous phone with same battery 5000mAh and having so many apps and gives good backup than this).Otherwise, camera quality, look and processor is good.My need was to have good battery backup and a good processor but it is able to fulfil only one. Not that much satisfied with this.

It's been 15days using this mobileIt's superb , battery is so good that i can't believe. It's looks like I phone, body is so clean and neat and perfectly designed. I loved it i bought that for my wife and she's is happy. More over its an huge success for lava . Made in India. Jaihind .

Bought it for my Mom. It is smooth fast and bloat free. It's camera is very good even after transferring to computer. No distortion. The photos taken using HD mode gives you much more clarity. Though the display is HD+  the videos are like planning in a hd+ display. Battery backup also very good. Charging once in two days without any gaming but only hotstar and YouTube videos. Totally satisfied.

After using Lava blaze mobile for two days I think this mobile is very good.  No problem, only the charger heats up while charging.  Battery drains faster when on net maybe it's due to 5g. but feeling is so soft

Phone like this from an Indian brand in this price range is commendable. Build quality is superb, 5g network is working great, wonderful performance, 6gb ram and 128gb ufs 2.2 storage is doing fine job. Camera quality is also good according to price

Camera is good trust me it's really a good camera far better than other chinise brand which cost around 20000, Display is awesome but you need to apply screen guard, battery backup is of one day. Sound is loud. Connectivity is at next level, no heating issue, software experience is at next level.Suggestion: If you are willing to purchase mobile under 16000 go for it. It is only in 12000 with 5g and 6 gb ram with awesome display and camera. Other will feel jealous if they see this premium phone in your hand
